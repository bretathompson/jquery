Currently, if you click the Remove button on a product on the cart.html page, the product will be removed from local storage but the display of the cart item will not change. We will remedy this problem in this task.

We placed the removeFromCart( ) function inside the app.js page so we can use it to remove products on either the shop.html or cart.html pages. The reason products are not being removed is that we are only calling the displayCart( ) function that refreshes the display of products on the shop.html page. We are not calling the displayCartProducts( ) function that refreshes the display of products on the cart.html page. The problem is, we can't simply call the displayCartProducts( ) function or we will receive an error on the shop.html because it contains code that does not exist on that page. To help with this problem, we will check to see if the displayCartProducts( ) function is a function (this checks if it exists on the page). If it is a function, go ahead and run it. Follow these directions to complete this step:
Inside the removeFromCart( ) function on the app.js page is a function call to the displayCart( ) function. Surround this function with an IF statement that checks whether the function exists. Here is the code:
if (typeof displayCart === "function") {
 displayCart();
 }
The above code will run the displayCart( ) function if it exists. We also want to create another IF statement that will run the displayCartProducts( ) function if it exists. Create this new IF statement directly below the previous IF statement. Here is the code:
if (typeof displayCartProducts === "function") {
 displayCartProducts();
 }
You should now be able to remove individual items by using the Remove link on the cart.html page:




Task 4: Configure the Clear Cart Button for cart.html

We also want the display of the cart page to update when the Clear Cart button is pressed. We will accomplish this by updating the clearCart( ) function on the app.js page in the same manner as we did in the previous task

Inside the clearCart( ) function on the app.js page, surround the displayCart( ) function call with an IF statement that checks if displayCart is a function. Your code should look like this:
 if (typeof displayCart === "function") {
 displayCart();
 }
Create a new IF statement directly below the displayCart IF statement that checks if displayCartProducts is a function. Call the displayCartProducts function inside the IF statement. Your code should look like this:
if (typeof displayCartProducts === "function") {
 displayCartProducts( );
 }
The Clear Cart button on the cart.html page should now remove all products from the page:
